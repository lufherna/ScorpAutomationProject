# ScorpAutomationProject
Using Cypress to test an API and confirm the results, along with testing the login page.

The tests are located in the 'cypress' folder under 'Integrations' there you will see three files. Two of which handle the main login page and the third handles
the API testing

In order to run this project you'll need to:

1. Download the project folder
2. Make sure Node is installed on your computer. If it isn't read this (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. Go to your computer's Terminal -> change the directory to the project -> type in 'npm install'
4. After the command above runs -> open Cypress by typing in 'node_modules/.bin/cypress open' -> Once this opens you'll see the option 'Run all specs' on the top right
5. All tests should run with the results

Please let me know what you think! I'm open to feedback and hearing how else i can optimize this. Thanks!
